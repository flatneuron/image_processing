# Image Processing Assessment Solution

This repository contains solutions for an image processing assessment using YOLO object detection. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook ([image_processing.ipynb](image_processing.ipynb)). The notebook provides detaled explaination of each step in comments and covers two main tasks:

- **Task 1:** Detection Summary Engine  
  Processes a video to detect objects every 5th frame, saves annotated frames, and generates detection summaries.
- **Task 2:** Real-Time Stream Simulation & Event Trigger  
  Simulates real-time detection, triggers alerts for crowd events, and visualizes alert occurrences.
